# Bangladesh ASCII Map Generator in C

A C program that uses a run-length decompression algorithm to generate a pixel-perfect ASCII art map of Bangladesh in the terminal.

This project is designed as a well-commented example of using a simple decompression engine to generate complex visual output from compact data. It's a great project for students and those new to C, with detailed comments in both English and "Banglish".
